{"prompt": "Task title: Set up CI pipeline", "completion": "Configure GitHub Actions to automatically run linting, unit tests, and Docker builds on every pull request and push to main. Ensure the pipeline fails fast on errors and notifies the team via Slack on failures."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Design auth system", "completion": "Implement JWT-based authentication with secure password hashing using bcrypt. Include registration, login, token refresh, and logout endpoints. Ensure tokens expire after 24 hours and sensitive routes are protected."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Build task CRUD API", "completion": "Create RESTful endpoints for full task lifecycle management including create, read, update, and delete operations. Implement proper validation, error handling, and role-based access so users can only modify their own tasks."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Add AI suggest endpoint", "completion": "Integrate OpenAI API to provide two AI features: task description generation from a short title, and daily plan generation based on the user's current task list. Include a deterministic stub fallback for testing."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Write integration tests", "completion": "Write pytest integration tests covering the full HTTP request lifecycle for critical endpoints. Use in-memory SQLite and AI stubs so tests run without external dependencies. Aim for 80% coverage on business logic."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Set up database migrations", "completion": "Configure Alembic for SQLAlchemy database migrations. Create initial migration for users and tasks tables. Ensure migrations run automatically on deployment and include rollback support."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Build kanban board UI", "completion": "Create a drag-and-drop Kanban board in React showing tasks grouped by status: Backlog, In Progress, Review, and Done. Each card should show title, time logged, and quick action buttons for status transitions."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Add rate limiting", "completion": "Implement API rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse. Limit unauthenticated users to 20 requests per minute and authenticated users to 200 requests per minute. Return 429 Too Many Requests with a Retry-After header when limits are exceeded."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Deploy to AWS ECS", "completion": "Containerise the application using Docker and deploy to AWS ECS Fargate. Set up an Application Load Balancer, RDS PostgreSQL database, and store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Configure auto-scaling based on CPU usage."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Implement search functionality", "completion": "Add full-text search across task titles and descriptions. Implement debounced search input in the frontend that filters tasks in real time. On the backend, use SQLAlchemy LIKE queries or integrate PostgreSQL full-text search for production."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Add email notifications", "completion": "Send email notifications when a task is assigned to a user or transitions to Review status. Use SendGrid or AWS SES for email delivery. Include task title, description, and a direct link to the task in the email body."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Fix login bug", "completion": "Investigate and resolve the authentication issue causing valid users to receive 401 Unauthorized responses after login. Check JWT token encoding, sub claim type consistency, and token storage in the frontend localStorage."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Optimise database queries", "completion": "Profile slow database queries using SQLAlchemy query logging and identify N+1 query problems. Add appropriate indexes on frequently filtered columns like status and owner_id. Target under 50ms for all task list queries."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Add dark mode", "completion": "Implement a dark and light mode toggle in the React frontend. Store the user's preference in localStorage so it persists across sessions. Use CSS variables for theming so switching modes requires only a class change on the root element."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Build reporting dashboard", "completion": "Create an analytics dashboard showing key engineering metrics: tasks completed per week, average cycle time per status, top contributors by minutes logged, and burndown chart for the current sprint. Use recharts for data visualisation."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Implement file upload", "completion": "Add file attachment support to tasks allowing users to upload screenshots, documents, and logs. Store files in AWS S3 with pre-signed URLs for secure access. Limit file size to 10MB and support common formats including PDF, PNG, JPG, and ZIP."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Add websocket support", "completion": "Implement WebSocket connections so task status changes and new comments are pushed to all connected clients in real time without polling. Use FastAPI's built-in WebSocket support and broadcast updates to all users viewing the same task board."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Write API documentation", "completion": "Create comprehensive API documentation covering all endpoints with request/response examples, authentication requirements, and error codes. FastAPI auto-generates Swagger UI at /docs — enhance it with detailed descriptions and example payloads for each endpoint."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Implement caching", "completion": "Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data like task lists and user profiles. Cache responses for 60 seconds with automatic invalidation when data changes. This should reduce database load by 70% for read-heavy endpoints."}
{"prompt": "Task title: Add two factor authentication", "completion": "Implement TOTP-based two-factor authentication using the pyotp library. Allow users to enable 2FA from their profile settings, scan a QR code with an authenticator app, and enter a 6-digit code on each login after password verification."}
